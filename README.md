# Gnoga_File_Selection
A file-selection dialog for obtain full path names of files on the computer that is running the program

Some Gnoga programs need to allow the user to choose a file on the computer that's running the program, not the computer that's running the browser (in the case of singleton programs, they're often the same). The program needs the full path of the file so it can open or create it. The "file" input type doesn't offer this capability.

Gnoga_File_Selection provides this ability. It's currently in beta state, having been tested on Linux only.
